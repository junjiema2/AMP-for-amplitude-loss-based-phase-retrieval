This Matlab code reproduces the simulation results reported in the following paper:

J. Ma, J. Xu and A. Maleki, "Optimization-Based AMP for Phase Retrieval: The Impact of Initialization and $\ell_{2}$ Regularization," in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 65, no. 6, pp. 3600-3629, June 2019.

  (1) The folder "Comparison - noiseless" includes comparisons with AMP.A with various existing algorithms for noiseless phase retrieval;
  (2) The folder "AMP noisy - positive signal" includes state evolution results of AMP.A for positive signal and deterministic initialization;
  (3) The folder "AMP noisy - Gaussian signal - spectral initialization" includes state evolution results for AMP.A with spectral initialization
